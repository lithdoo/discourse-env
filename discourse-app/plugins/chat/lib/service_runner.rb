#
# This class is to be used via its helper +with_service+ in any class. Its
# main purpose is to ease how actions can be run upon a service completion.
# Since a service will likely return the same kind of things over and over,
# this allows us to not have to repeat the same boilerplate code in every
# object.
#
# There are several available actions and we can add new ones very easily:
#
# * +on_success+: will execute the provided block if the service succeeds
# * +on_failure+: will execute the provided block if the service fails
# * +on_failed_policy(name)+: will execute the provided block if the policy
#   named `name` fails
# * +on_failed_contract(name)+: will execute the provided block if the contract
#   named `name` fails
# * +on_model_not_found(name)+: will execute the provided block if the service
#   fails and its model is not present
#
# @example In a controller
#   def create
#     with_service MyService do
#       on_success do
#         flash[:notice] = "Success!"
#         redirect_to a_path
#       end
#       on_failed_policy(:a_named_policy) { redirect_to root_path }
#       on_failure { render :new }
#     end
#   end
#
# @example In a job (inheriting from +ServiceJob+)
#   def execute(args = {})
#     with_service(MyService, **args) do
#       on_success { Rails.logger.info "SUCCESS" }
#       on_failure { Rails.logger.error "FAILURE" }
#     end
#   end
#
# The actions will be evaluated in the order they appear. So even if the
# service will ultimately fail with a failed policy, in this example only the
# +on_failed_policy+ action will be executed and not the +on_failure+ one.
# The only exception to this being +on_failure+ as it will always be executed
# last.
